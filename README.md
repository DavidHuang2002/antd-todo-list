# TODO LIST

A project for me to learn the basics of ant design.

You can find the resulting app on [this page](https://davidhuang2002.github.io/antd-todo-list/)

## Info

It uses antd components `<Input>` `<List>`to track of todo items and uses `<DatePicker>` and the actions prop of `<Input>` to allow delete todo item and select date for the item.

after having the basic functionality done, I went on to add simple undo/redo functionality on my own.
